## Introduction

Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk is a cutting-edge, automated tool designed to revolutionize the job search and application process. In today's fiercely competitive job market, where opportunities can vanish in the blink of an eye, this program offers job seekers a significant advantage by leveraging the power of automation and artificial intelligence.

### The Challenge of Modern Job Hunting

In the digital age, the job search landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation. While online platforms have opened up a world of opportunities, they have also intensified competition. Job seekers often find themselves spending countless hours scrolling through listings, tailoring applications, and repetitively filling out forms. This process can be not only time-consuming but also emotionally draining, leading to job search fatigue and missed opportunities.

  - 3.12.5(64b)

### Option 1: Using Python Virtual Environment 

1. **Download and Install Python:**

   Ensure you have the last Python version  installed. If not, download and install it from Python's official website. For detailed instructions, refer to the tutorials:

   - [How to Install Python on Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-windows/)
   - [How to Install Python on Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-linux/)
   - [How to Download and Install Python on macOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-python-latest-version-on-macos-mac-os-x/)

2. **Download and Install Google Chrome:**
   - Download and install the latest version of Google Chrome from its default location on the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome).

3. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feder-cr/Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk.git
   
   cd Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk
   ```

4. **Activate virtual environment:**

   For Unix-based machines -
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv virtual
   ```

   ```bash
   source virtual/bin/activate
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### 1. secrets.yaml

This file contains sensitive information. Never share or commit this file to version control.

- `llm_api_key: [Your OpenAI or Ollama API key or Gemini API key]`
  - Replace with your OpenAI API key for GPT integration
  - To obtain an API key, follow the tutorial at: <https://medium.com/@lorenzozar/how-to-get-your-own-openai-api-key-f4d44e60c327>
  - Note: You need to add credit to your OpenAI account to use the API. You can add credit by visiting the [OpenAI billing dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing).
  - According to the [OpenAI community](https://community.openai.com/t/usage-tier-free-to-tier-1/919150) and our users' reports, right after setting up the OpenAI account and purchasing the required credits, users still have a `Free` account type. This prevents them from having unlimited access to OpenAI models and allows only 200 requests per day. This might cause runtime errors such as:  
    `Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. ...}}`  
    `{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini in organization <org> on requests per day (RPD): Limit 200, Used 200, Requested 1.}}`  
    OpenAI will update your account automatically, but it might take some time, ranging from a couple of hours to a few days.  
    You can find more about your organization's limits on the [official page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).
  - For obtaining Gemini API key visit [Google AI for Devs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)

### PLUS. data_folder_example

The `data_folder_example` folder contains a working example of how the files necessary for the bot's operation should be structured and filled out. This folder serves as a practical reference to help you correctly set up your work environment for the job search bot.

#### Contents

Inside this folder, you'll find example versions of the key files:

- `secrets.yaml`
- `plain_text_resume.yaml`

These files are already populated with fictitious but realistic data. They show you the correct format and type of information to enter in each file.

#### Using the data_folder_example

Using this folder as a guide can be particularly helpful for:

1. Understanding the correct structure of each configuration file
2. Seeing examples of valid data for each field
3. Having a reference point while filling out your personal files

## Usage

1. **Data Folder:**
   Ensure that your data_folder contains the following files:
   - `secrets.yaml`
   - `plain_text_resume.yaml`

2. **Output Folder:**
    Contains the output of the bot.

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. OpenAI API Rate Limit Errors

**Error Message:**

openai.RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors>.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

**Solution:**

- Check your OpenAI API billing settings at <https://platform.openai.com/account/billing>
- Ensure you have added a valid payment method to your OpenAI account
- Note that ChatGPT Plus subscription is different from API access
- If you've recently added funds or upgraded, wait 12-24 hours for changes to take effect
- Free tier has a 3 RPM limit; spend at least $5 on API usage to increase

#### 2. Incorrect Information in Job Applications

**Issue:** Bot provides inaccurate data for experience, CTC, and notice period

**Solution:**

- Update prompts for professional experience specificity
- Add fields in `config.py` for current CTC, expected CTC, and notice period
- Modify bot logic to use these new config fields

#### 3. YAML Configuration Errors

**Error Message:**

yaml.scanner.ScannerError: while scanning a simple key

**Solution:**

- Copy example `config.yaml` and modify gradually
- Ensure proper YAML indentation and spacing
- Use a YAML validator tool
- Avoid unnecessary special characters or quotes


### General Troubleshooting Tips
